| Package       | Purpose
| scanner       | Scan a text file and create Neo4j nodes for packages and relationships for links.
| store         | contains jQAssistant compliant descriptors for Neo4j nodes.

==== Known Technical Debt

*Unwanted Dependencies*

During the lifetime many features were added. For some of them, a building block needs information stored in
a different building block or has to call functionality of another building block - but these new connections
lead to circular dependencies. To keep the System maintainable, the architecture must be improved:
resolve dependency circles, move responsibilities etc. Open tasks are:

| de.kontext_e.demo.one     | de.kontext_e.demo.two | Because one makes StatusDTO out of ReceivedMessage from two to hold a list of Sensor stati; Todo: let the ProcessSensorStatusCommand convert the ReceivedMessage into StatusDTO
| de.kontext_e.demo.three   | de.kontext_e.demo.four| Because one makes StatusDTO out of ReceivedMessage from two to hold a list of Sensor stati; Todo: let the ProcessSensorStatusCommand convert the ReceivedMessage into StatusDTO

==== Design Pattern of Classes Matched by Regular Expressions

Just as Carola Lilienthal explains in her talks, classes which
use Design Patterns may be identified by regular expressions.
She does it in her analysis tools, but a better way is to document
it in the Architecture Documentation. It could be done like in
this example.

| de.kontext_e.jqassistant.*Factory     | Factory
